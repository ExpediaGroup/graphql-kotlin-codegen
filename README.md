# GraphQL Kotlin Codegen

GraphQL Kotlin Codegen is a plugin for [graphql-codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) that generates Kotlin code from
[Schema Definition Language (SDL)](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/lift-off-part1/03-schema-definition-language-sdl).
This Kotlin code is meant to be consumed by services using [GraphQL Kotlin](https://opensource.expediagroup.com/graphql-kotlin/docs/) and allows SDL to drive the implementation of your schema.
In essence, it unlocks a schema-first approach to [code-first GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/schema-first-vs-code-only-graphql).
